Follow the idea...
<h1>This coding was developer in HTML,CSS and JS</h1>
The main idea behind it, is using my experience that I have been studying recently and apply on this app. Experiences such as:<br>
- Organise coding in HTML<br>
- Organise coding in CSS<br>
- Using JavaScript which I am studying these days
